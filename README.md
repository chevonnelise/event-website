## About This Project
**User Problems & Pain Points**
This website features singer Taylor Swift, her 2023-2024 Eras Tour and her 10 albums. Hence, the primary users would be Swifties who are keen to learn more about the Eras Tour performance venues and songs, especially those who miss her performances.

**Theme**
* Concert theme as shown by the concert hero image, microphone icons, and video of live performances.

**Colours**
* Using a mixture of various shades of yellow, brown, black and pink, the colour scheme is meant to embody the excitement that concert goers feel when attending concerts. 
* Red & Orange: Reflecting the fiery energy of a live performance, orange injects warmth and excitement into the color palette, capturing the adrenaline rush and enthusiasm of concert attendees. 
* Dynamic Yellow: Yellow symbolizes positivity and joy, perfectly capturing the euphoria and high spirits that accompany the live music experience.
* Pink: A bold and attention-grabbing hue, neon pink adds a playful and vibrant touch to the color scheme, symbolizing the lively and exhilarating experience of live music.

Users can navigate the 4 main sections via the navbar:

2. **Event Venue**
- Marked by microphone icons on the map, yellow microphone icons indicate each unique performing Eras Tour venue. 
As users zoom out, they can locate clusters of performing venues marked by the pink microphone icons. These are where most of the performing venues are found.

- On the left side pane, there are 3 icons: 
   * Taylor Swift silouhette icon , which is aligned with the website icon;
   * Search icon where users can click to search for various facilities around; 
   * Taxi icon where users can click to locate the taxis available near them, a 'Start' and 'End' button will appear so that users can plot their journey from start to destined location. This will populate the navigation fields on the top right of the map. On each click on the map, the user will be able to identify the temperature and whether to dress for hot/cold weather.

- Below the top right navigation panel, user can expand the cluster button to toggle between viewing the Eras Tour venues versus search results only.
